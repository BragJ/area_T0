PICAM is a C++ library provided by Princeton Instruments, a division of Roper 
Scientific, Inc.  This library provides a common API to drive a number of 
cameras from Princeton Instruments.  This library is freely available, 
downloadable, and redistributable.  We have included header and library files
here for version 2.8.1.1408 as a convenience for building the EPICS areaDetector
driver.

Princeton Instruments provides up to date versions of the PICAM driver library
on their website and would prefer users to install directly from their site.  

The latest version of PICAM is available from this URL:
