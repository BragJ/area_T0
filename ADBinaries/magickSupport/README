The files in the os/WIN32 directory were built with MS Visual Studio 2008 from
GraphicsMagick-1.3.12.  This was done in the VisualMagick subdirectory.  Two
builds were done: one for the WIN32 and a second for x64.  The resulting .lib
files were copied to the os/WIN32 and os/WIN32/x64 directories.

HOWEVER, this worked fine for the x64 build.  But for the 32-bit build linking
of applications failed when using the files built with 2008.  By building with 
2005 again it worked.  This needs to be tracked down.

The header files were copied from the magick and magick++ directories.  I think
they were copied from the Windows distribution, not the Linux distribution, but
they should be the same.
