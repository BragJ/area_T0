    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> <a href="areaDetector.html">
      areaDetector</a> driver for the flat-panel amorphous silicon detectors from <a href="http://optoelectronics.perkinelmer.com/catalog/Category.aspx?CategoryName=X-Ray+Cameras">
        PerkinElmer</a>.</p>
  <p>
    The driver is based upon the XISL library provided by PerkinElmer. It only runs
    on Microsoft Windows computers. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    This driver has been tested with the following detectors</p>
  <ul>
    <li>XRD0820 with XRD-FG PCI frame grabber</li>
    <li>XRD0822 with Gigabit Ethernet interface</li>
    <li>XRD1621 with XRD-FGX PCI frame grabber</li>
    <li>XRD1621 with XRD-FGe Opto PCI-Express frame grabber</li>
    <li>XRPAD with Gigabit Ethernet interface</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to the PerkinElmer detectors. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_perkin_elmer.html">
      PerkinElmer class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>
  <h2 id="StandardNotes" style="text-align: left">
    Implementation of standard driver parameters</h2>

    The following table describes how the PerkinElmer driver implements some of the
    standard driver parameters.

          An offset that is added to the image when the offset correction is performed. CorrectedImage
          = RawImage - OffsetImage + OffsetConstant. This constant should be used to prevent
          the CorrectedImage from having any negative pixel values, which would otherwise
          be clipped to 0. For efficiency this value is actually subtracted from the offset
          image as soon as it is collected, so it is then effectively added to each image
          when offset correction is done. This results in 2 restrictions:
          <ol>
            <li>PEOffsetConstant must be specified before the offset images are collected. If
              it is changed then the offset images must be collected again.</li>
            <li>The value must be less than the minimum value of the offset image, or else negative
              values will result. In practice this should not be a problem, since an offset of
              100 should be sufficient to prevent negative values during offset correction, and
              the offset images are always greater than 100.</li>

  <h2 id="Unsupported">
    Unsupported standard driver parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The PerkinElmer driver does not support the following standard driver parameters
    because they are not supported in the PerkinElmer library:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Readout region (ADMinX, ADMinY, ADSizeX, ADSizeY)</li>
    <li>Type/Color (NDDataType, NDColorMode)</li>
    <li>File (None of the file parameters in NDFile)</li>
    <li>No Hardware shutter control </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Synchronization">
    Synchronization and triggering</h2>
  <p>
    The Perkin Elmer detectors support a number of acquisition modes which are controlled
    by the TriggerMode, SyncMode, and AcquireTime records. This is a simplified discussion,
    and the reader should consult the <a href="1000952_Manual_XIS_Rev7.pdf">XIS software
      manual</a> and the detector hardware manuals (e.g. <a href="Manual_PKIaSi_XRD1621 2008-07-30.pdf">
        1621 hardware manual</a>) for details.</p>
  <p>
    The number of frames to be acquired is always controlled by the ImageMode=(Single,
    Multiple, or Continuous) and NumImages (if ImageMode=Multiple) records, regardless
    of the values of the TriggerMode, SyncMode, and AcquireTime records.</p>
  <p>
    It is important to realize that the detector hardware is constantly acquiring a
    stream of frames even when the EPICS Acquire record is 0. The rate of this frame
    stream depends on the value of the TriggerMode:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TriggerMode="Free Running" The frame rate is the maximum that the detector supports.</li>
    <li>TriggerMode="Internal" The frame rate is controlled by an internal clock whose
      period is set to AcquireTime.</li>
    <li>TriggerMode="External" The frame rate is controlled by the frequency of the external
      trigger pulses.</li>
    <li>TriggerMode="Soft Trigger" The frame rate is controlled by the rate at which the
      PETrigger record is processed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When SyncMode=Framewise and acquisition is started by setting Acquire=1 then the
    first frame that the EPICS driver collects is the next frame in that frame stream.
    <b>NOTE:</b> this means that this frame probably started exposing before Acquire
    was set to 1. This may not be desirable since motors may have still been moving,
    or a shutter not yet opened. When acquiring a sequence of images (ImageMode=Multiple)
    this would only affect the first image in the sequence, which might be acceptable.
    However, if doing a step-scan with ImageMode=Single it would affect every image
    in the scan. There are two ways to handle this. One is to use SyncMode=Framewise
    and set PENumFramesToSkip=1. This is quite inefficient since on average it will
    have an overhead of AcquireTime/2, and a worst case overhead of AcquireTime. A better
    approach is to set FrameSync="DDD No Clear", which adds a small overhead to each
    frame (~0.1-0.2 seconds), but ensures that the exposure is started after Acquire
    is set to 1.</p>
  <h3>
    TriggerMode=Free Running</h3>
  <p>
    In this mode the AcquireTime is ignored, and the detector runs at the maximum possible
    frame rate and a fixed minimum exposure time. SyncMode should be set to Framewise
    in this mode.</p>
  <h3>
    TriggerMode=Internal</h3>
  <p>
    In this mode the behavior depends on the setting of SyncMode.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If SyncMode="Framewise" then the detector hardware is constantly acquiring a stream
      of images with a frame rate determined by the AcquireTime record, up to the maximum
      frame rate the detector is capable of. When Acquire is set to 1 then this driver
      begins acquiring the images and doing callbacks to plugins. This is the fastest
      way to run the detector with a user-programmable acquisition time. However, it suffers
      from the limitation described above that the first frame after Acquire is set to
      1 actually was being exposed before Acquire was set to 1. This may not be desired,
      particularly when ImageMode=Single. <b>NOTE:</b> the XRPAD detectors cannot use
      this mode because they are limited to a single internal frame rate and the AcquireTime
      record has no effect in this mode.</li>
    <li>If SyncMode="DDD No Clear" then the detector hardware is constantly acquiring
      a stream of images at the maximum possible frame rate. However, when Acquire is
      set to 1 this driver sends a software trigger to the detector. This causes the hardware
      to discard the next frame when it arrives and to start a new exposure with an exposure
      time of AcquireTime. When the frame completes then the driver sends the next software
      trigger in the frame callback function. When running in this mode there is no limitation
      on the first frame containing data from before Acquire was set to 1. It does have
      the limitation that there is additional overhead per frame, so the maximum frame
      rate is reduced. On the XRD1621 this overhead is ~0.2 second in 2048x2048 mode,
      and ~0.1 seconds in 1024x1024 mode. This mode is recommended when running with ImageMode=Single.
      If running with ImageMode=Multiple then this mode should be used if the first frame
      limitation described above is a problem. If the limitation of "DDD No Clear" mode
      on frame rate is more important than the limitation of "Framewise" mode on the first
      frame then one should use SyncMode="Framewise". </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    TriggerMode=External</h3>
  <p>
    In this mode the behavior also depends on the setting of SyncMode.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If SyncMode="Framewise" then the detector hardware is constantly acquiring a stream
      of images with a frame rate determined by the time between external trigger pulses,
      up to the maximum frame rate the detector is capable of. When Acquire is set to
      1 then this driver begins acquiring the images and doing callbacks to plugins. This
      is the fastest way to run the detector with an external trigger. However, it has
      some potential problems. First, if the time between external triggers is not constant
      then the exposure time of the frames will be different. This can lead to serious
      data quality issues because the offset correction will not be correct. If the time
      between trigger pulses is constant then there is still a potential data quality
      problem if the offset images were not collected with exactly the time acquisition
      time, for example if they will collected with an TriggerMode=Internal and a slightly
      different acquisition time. Of course this is not an issue if the offset images
      are acquired with the same external trigger period used for the data images, but
      this may be difficult to arrange in practice.</li>
    <li>If SyncMode="DDD No Clear" then the detector hardware is constantly acquiring
      a stream of images at the maximum possible frame rate. However, when an external
      trigger pulse is received this causes the hardware to discard the next frame when
      it arrives and to start a new exposure with an exposure time of AcquireTime. This
      mode thus allows acquiring for a fixed exposure time on each external trigger, rather
      than the time until the next trigger is received. This means that offset images
      can be simply collected with TriggerMode=Internal and the same AcquireTime. This
      mode does have the limitation that there is additional overhead per frame, so the
      maximum frame rate is reduced. The overhead is the same as described above for TriggerMode=Internal,
      SyncMode=""Framewise".</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    TriggerMode="Soft Trigger"</h3>
  <p>
    In this mode the behavior also depends on the setting of SyncMode.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If SyncMode="Framewise" then the detector hardware is constantly acquiring a stream
      of images with a frame rate determined by the time between software triggers from
      the PETrigger record, up to the maximum frame rate the detector is capable of. When
      Acquire is set to 1 then this driver begins acquiring the images and doing callbacks
      to plugins. This is the fastest way to run the detector with a software trigger.
      However, it has the same potential problems as TriggerMode=External and SyncMode="Framewise"
      described above. In the case of software triggers the problem may be even more important
      if the time between software triggers has significant variation.</li>
    <li>If SyncMode="DDD No Clear" then the detector hardware is constantly acquiring
      a stream of images at the maximum possible frame rate. However, when a software
      trigger is received this causes the hardware to discard the next frame when it arrives
      and to start a new exposure with an exposure time of AcquireTime. This mode thus
      allows acquiring for a fixed exposure time on each software trigger, rather than
      the time until the next software trigger is received. This means that offset images
      can be simply collected with TriggerMode=Internal and the same AcquireTime. This
      mode does have the limitation that there is additional overhead per frame, so the
      maximum frame rate is reduced. The overhead is the same as described above for TriggerMode=Internal,
      SyncMode=""Framewise".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It is important that the offset images are collected with the same SyncMode as the
    data. If the offset images are collected with SyncMode=Framewise and the data are
    collected with SyncMode="DDD No Clear" then the offset correction will not be correct,
    even if both are collected with the same AcquireTime. When using SyncMode="DDD No
    Clear" it is fine to collect the offset and data images with different values of
    TriggerMode. For example the offset images could be collected with TriggerMode=Internal
    and the data images collected with TriggerMode=External.</p>
