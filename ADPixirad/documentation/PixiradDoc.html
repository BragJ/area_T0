    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/">EPICS</a> <a href="areaDetector.html">
      areaDetector</a> driver for the Pixirad detectors from <a href="http://pixirad.pi.infn.it/">
        PiXirad</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Pixirad detector is a pixel array detector with a cadmium teluride (CdTe) sensor,
    so it has high efficiency at high energy. The base module is 476 x 512 pixels, which
    is what this driver currently supports. Detectors with more than one base module
    are available, and will be supported by this driver in the future.</p>
  <p>
    The detector does photon counting of all photons above a programmable energy threshold.
    The detector hardware has 2 energy thresholds and two counters per pixel, so it
    can collect 2 energy images simultaneously. The firmware supports 4 thresholds,
    by first collecting 2 energies, and then collecting another image with 2 additional
    energies. The detector can be operated in 1, 2, or 4 color mode. In addition it
    supports deadtime-free (DTF) counting modes where one image is being collected while
    the other is being read out. Both 1 and 2 color DTF modes are supported. The NDArrays
    produced by this driver are unsigned 16-bit integers. They have dimensions [476,
    512] for 1 color images, [476, 512, 2] for 2 color images, and [476, 512, 4] for
    4 color images.
  </p>
  <p>
    The command interface to the detector is via a TCP/IP socket interface to the detector
    on port 2222.</p>
  <p>
    The driver receives status information from the detector via UDP broadcast messages
    on port 2224. The status includes temperatures, humidity and high voltage.</p>
  <p>
    The driver receives image data from the detector via UDP broadcast messages on port
    2223. This data is received by a "UDP listener thread" in the driver, which passes
    the UDP buffers as they are received via a pointer on an epicsMessageQueue to a
    "data unpacking thread". This second thread unscrambles the UDP buffers, converts
    them to areaDetector NDArrays, and does the callbacks to registered plugins. The
    size of the epicsMessageQueue is controlled by a parameter passed to the driver
    constructor, and is set to 1500 in the example IOC. This provides a buffer in case
    the UDP listener thread is receiving images faster than the data unpacking thread
    can process them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The detector can in principle be on a public network where it will receive its IP
    address from a DHCP server. In practice the current detector firmware does not work
    correctly in this configuration, because the UDP messages do not use the correct
    network addresses. This means that the detector must be placed on a private network
    with no DHCP server. It will always have the network address 192.168.0.1. This also
    means that the computer running the areaDetector driver must have 2 network cards,
    with the one connected to the detector having a host address on the 192.168.0 subnet.</p>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to the Pixirad detectors. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classpixirad.html">
      pixirad class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>
  <h2 id="StandardNotes" style="text-align: left">
    Implementation of standard driver parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The following table describes how the Pixirad driver implements some of the standard
    driver parameters.

          Note that the dimensions of the NDArrays from the Pixirad driver depend on the value

          1 color arrays are 2-D with dimensions [MaxSizeX, MaxSizeY].<br />
          2 color arrays are 3-D with dimensions [MaxSizeX, MaxSizeY, 2].<br />

  <p>
    When collecting 2 or 4 color images it is useful to use NDPluginROI to select a
    single color. This can be done by defining an ROI with X and Y set to the full detector
    size (AutoSizeX=Yes, AutoSizeY=Yes) and Z set to AutoSizeX=No and SizeZ=1. MinZ
    can then be used to select a single color (0=color 1, 1=color2, etc.). If the NDStdArrays
    plugin is set to get its data from this ROI plugin then the ImageJ display client
    will display the selected color image.

    The measurements above were made with TriggerMode=Internal. Additional measurements
    made using TriggerMode=External showed that the maximum frame rate was the same
    as that shown in the table, i.e. as soon as the external trigger frequency exceeded
    this value the detector ignored every second external trigger pulse.</p>
  <p>
    The data above show that the detector overhead is about 7.5 ms in "1 color low";
    mode. In "1 color DTF"; mode the overhead is about 0.7 ms, but with a minimum frame
    period of 7 ms. In "2 color" mode the overhead is 15 ms, or 7.5 ms per image, the
    same as in "1 color low". In "4 color" mode two exposures are required. The total
    time is equal to AcquireTime*2 + 0.0075*4, so again the overhead is about 7.5 ms
    per image.</p>
  <h2 id="Restrictions">
    Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    The following are some current restrictions of the Pixirad driver due to bugs in
    the Pixirad firmware:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The detector does not accept a high-voltage value unless 2 different values are
      sent to it after power-cycle or system reset. The areaDetector driver works around
      this problem by sending the requested voltage minus 1.0 and then the requested voltage
      when the IOC starts up, and also after a system reset. However, it appears that
      even this is sometimes not sufficient. To see if this is a problem set the HVState
      to On and see if the HVActual is close to the requested value. If it is not, for
      example if it is only 12V or so, then change the HVValue to something else and then
      back to the requested value. This should fix the problem. </li>
    <li>At high frame rates there can be occasional loss of UDP packets. This will result
      in an error message on the IOC console, UDPBuffersRead will be fewer than NumImages,
      and the Acquire PV will not go back to 0. If this happens then press the Stop button
      (setting Acquire to 0). If a DTF sequence was being acquired then sometimes all
      subsequent images will be corrupted, and it will be necessary to restart the EPICS
      IOC.</li>
    <li>If a long acquisition sequence is started it is not currently possible to make
      the detector abort it. There is a command that can be sent to the detector to abort
      an acquisition, but unfortunately this causes the detector to malfunction for subsequent
      acquisitions.</li>
    <li>The detector does not send UDP status packets during acquisition. If the HVMode=Auto
      and HVState=Off, which is a normal way to operate, then the HVActual readback will
      be 0 during acquisition, because no status update happens after the high voltage
      is automatically turned on at the start of acquisition. Immediately upon completion
      of acquisition the status updates begin, and a few non-zero values will be observed
      as the high voltage ramps down. This is normal, but it may cause confusion, since
      it appears that the high voltage has not been turned on during acquisition, when
      actually it was.</li>
  </ul>
