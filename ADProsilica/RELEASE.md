Release Notes
=============

R2-1 (16-April-2015)
----
* Fixed bug in asynPrintIO call in frameCallback. It was printing data on previous frame, 
  not current frame, and would crash if executed on first callback.
* Changes for compatibility with ADCore R2-2.

R2-0 (20-March-2014)
----
* Moved the repository to [Github](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADProsilica).
* Re-organized the directory structure to separate the driver library from the example IOC application.
* Fixes for connection management to handle multiple cameras per IOC. Thanks to Kate Feng.
* Added support for conversion from raw Bayer to RGB1, RGB2, and RGB3 in the driver. 
  In areaDetector releases prior to R2-0 this could be done in the NDPluginColorConvert plugin.  
  That capability has been removed from the plugin to make the plugin independent of the AVT PvApi library.

R1-9-1 and earlier
