This directory contains the source code for JPEG, which is built for Windows
only.

It is based on jpeg-6b with the following changes:

- Makefile rewritten to use EPICS build system
- tif_stream.cxx renamed to tif_stream.cpp for EPICS compatibility
- jconfic.vc copied to jconfig.h
- Added __ifdef __cplusplus to jpeglib.h to allow use of the header file from
  C++ code with C linkage to JPEG library
