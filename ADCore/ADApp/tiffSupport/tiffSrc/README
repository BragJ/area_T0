This directory contains the source code for TIFF, which is built for Windows
only.

It is based on tiff-4.0.3 with the following changes:

- Makefile rewritten to use EPICS build system
- tif_stream.cxx renamed to tif_stream.cpp for EPICS compatibility
- tif_confix.vc.h copied to tif_config.h
- tiffconf.vc.h copied to tiffconf.h
